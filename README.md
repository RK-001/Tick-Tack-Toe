# Tick-Tack-Toe
We are going to build a two-player tic-tac-toe game, which we will be able to play against the computer. Initially, we’ll make an empty game board and then we’ll take inputs from the players and we’ll check for the winning condition and if the whole board gets filled, the results will be declared as “user  won” or “It's tie”.
